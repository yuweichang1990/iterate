One command starts a multi-iteration loop: research any topic or build features with automatic planning, enhancement, and structured Markdown output. Exploration templates (deep-dive, quickstart, architecture-review, security-audit, comparison), HTML report export, compare mode, session resume, interactive steering, token usage reports, budget-controlled rate limiting, dual research/build modes, CJK/bilingual support, and auto-generated summaries.",
